# Cache and Memory Hierarchy Simulator
This project implements a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator in C++. The simulator is capable of modeling different cache configurations and memory hierarchies, including:

    Single-level (L1) cache
    Two-level (L1 + L2) cache
    Caches with stream buffer prefetching

Key Features:

    Configurable cache parameters: size, associativity, and block size
    LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy
    Write-back and write-allocate policies
    Stream buffer prefetching (for advanced configurations)
    Trace-driven simulation

Metrics Calculated:

    Cache hit/miss rates
    Memory traffic
    Average Access Time (AAT)
    Area estimates
    Dynamic energy estimates
